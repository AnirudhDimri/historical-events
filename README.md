In events.ipynb file I've scrapped the historical data via python code automation and created a dataset/csv file with all the important dates
and the events that occured on the following date.

In the main.py file I've created a webpage via streamlit library. In following webpage the user can enter a particular date and as a result,
the webpage will list the top 3 important events occured on that day.

>REQUIREMENTS(main.py):
Install streamlit
Install pandas

>REQUIREMENTS(events.ipynb):
Import Requests
Import BeautifulSoup
Import Pandas

>INSTRUCTIONS:
>In order to run the following application, the events.csv file should be uploaded in the same place as the main.py
>To run the app, open the main.py file and enter the following command in the terminal: "streamlit run main.py"
